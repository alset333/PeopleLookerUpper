# PeopleLookerUpper

A program to lookup info about someone. Really only works for someone well-known, as it currently only searches Wolfram Alpha. 

You'll need a Wolfram Alpha API key to use this program. You can get a free developer-level one from their website.
The key should be saved as just plaintext into a file "WOLFRAM_ALPHA_API_KEY.txt" in the directory with the program's other files.

Keep your key private, as (like many APIs) the developer one has it's number of monthly queries very limited. You don't want others to use up your queries, or you'll have to change your key!
You need a paid key with more monthly queries for large scale use.
